======================

Ports/Clonses:
--------------
First of all, it's a shell script, because it makes sense to write things like
this as shell scripts on the platforms I use. That means unix for now, 
obviously, but all these tools have equivalents on any usable platform in the 
world today, so make a version that uses it, fork if necessary, and make it so
people can pull off this cheap trick on any platform they want.

Special SMS Support?:
---------------------
It would be very useful to be able to send Type-0 SMS Messages thereby eliciting
an automatic response which could be used in lieu of process-of-elimination.
I'm not remotely sure it's possible to trick a phone into thinking an sms from
a gateway is a Ping SMS but if it is it would be useful.
